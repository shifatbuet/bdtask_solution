Problem:

Suppose Bdtask Limited company plans to recruit a certain number of employees. We are paying hourly basis salaries to each employee per month. Hour calculation is quite interesting. For example, we offer you 30,000 BDT per month as basic salary.To get this amount you have to work 8 hours daily except government holiday and friday.We also deduct 3% for provident fund from basic.Insurance premium is 5000 per year of each employee to cover accident and hospital coverage where company pay 50% and remaining paid by employee.We also provide 5% revenue  share with technical team member which is payable once after finishing financial year. In 2020, revenue will be about 2 crore taka and technical team members are 50.

Question
If you work an average 9 hours per day and there are 3 extra holidays except friday, what is the impact on your monthly salary and expected earnings per month?
